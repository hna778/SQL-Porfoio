## Project Background

The real estates in Tennesee has been noticed to be active in the last decade, with high amount of sale transactions reported, especially Nashville city. This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swsw1717/nashville-housing-sql-project?select=Nashville+Housing.csv.) was collected from Jan 02, 2013 to Dec 13, 2019 in Tennessee. In this project, the raw dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to uncover key trends and insights.

The main goal of this project is to understand the distribution of price range of the properties as well to uncover the sale trends whether there is high inventory in the market (home sales as vacant), the home price is climbing up. Would the home size, or year built impact the sale price
