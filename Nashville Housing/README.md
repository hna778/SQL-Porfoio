## Nashville Housing Market 

### Project Background

This report presents analysis of real estate transactions across Tennessee, with a particular focus on the dynamic housing market of Nashville. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand the distribution of property prices and uncover the market trends that reflect inventory levels, pricing dynamics, and the impact of property charateristics. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support strategic decision-making of home buyers by highlighting emerging opportunities, potential risks, and factors driving overall market performance.

### Executive Summary

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swsw1717/nashville-housing-sql-project?select=Nashville+Housing.csv.) encompasses approximately 56,000 property transactions recorded between January 2, 2013, and December 13, 2019 in Tennessee. However, the most reflecting a period of sustained growth and heightened real estate activity across Tennessee is between January 2, 2013, and Oct 31, 2016. During this timeframe, annual sales volume peaked in 2015 before slowing down in 2016, with Nashville contributing more than 70% of total transaction values in each year â€” underscoring its dominant role in statewide housing dynamics. Within Nashville, residential condo and single-family homes represented the largest market share, accounting for almost 70% of total property sales.
Over the four-year period (from 2013 to 2016), number of properties were sold as vacant rose by 10% in 2014 and 2015 compared to previous year, suggesting new area developments and supply-side activity. This may explain the reason home-selling activity began to decelerate in the later years of the dataset, indicating a potential shift toward market stabilization or early signs of saturation
