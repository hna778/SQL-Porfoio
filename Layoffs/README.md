# Dataset Details
The dataset compiles information on tech layoffs from multiple public sources. The data covers events from March 11, 2020 - the date COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic - up to the present. It includes the details of companies, industries, and the scales of workforce reductions across the global tech sector. 

# Project Overview
Layoffs have become a major topic of discussion worldwide, driven by economic uncertainty and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. In this project, the raw dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to uncover key trends and insights.

The main goal is to understand the post COVID-19 labor market and identify which industries and companies have been most affected. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, this project aims to highlight the patterns behind workforce reductions and provide a data-driven view of how the tech landscape continues to evolve.
