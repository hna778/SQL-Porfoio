## Project Background
Layoffs have become a major topic of discussion worldwide, driven by economic uncertainty and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) compiles information on tech layoffs from multiple public sources. The data covers events from **March 11, 2020** - the date COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic - **up to the present**. In this project, the raw dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to uncover key trends and insights.

The main goal is to understand the post COVID-19 labor market and identify which industries and companies have been most affected. Through exploratory data analysis, this project aims to highlight the patterns behind workforce reductions and provide a data-driven view of how the tech landscape continues to evolve.

The SQL queries utilized to load and organize the data can be found [here](https://github.com/hna778/SQL-Porfoio/blob/main/Layoffs/layoffs_Loading.sql).
